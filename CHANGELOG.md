All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- Typing a keyword in any app replaces it with its snippet's text, strictly (the whole word) or loosely (the end of what you've typed).
- Snippets can use variables for the clipboard, the date and time (with shifts and custom formats), environment variables, and other snippets.
- A snippet can ask for values when it fires, in one small form near the window you're typing in.
- If you switch to another app while a snippet's form is open or its script runs, the expansion is cancelled instead of being typed into the wrong app.
- A snippet can press keys, send a shortcut, wait, put the caret where you want it, open an app, run a macOS Shortcut, or run a script.
- Your clipboard is put back, with everything on it, after each expansion.
- A picker, opened by a shortcut you can change (Control-Option-Command-Space to start), searches snippets and inserts the one you choose.
- Settings has groups of snippets you can turn on or off, an editor with an Insert Variable menu, and general options for launching at login and turning expansion off.
- Snippets live in a YAML file you can edit by hand, and xpnd reloads it when it changes.
- Import and export snippets as YAML, choosing what happens to keywords that already exist, and confirming any imported snippet that would run a script, open an app, run a Shortcut, or send a keyboard shortcut.
- The menu bar icon turns expansion on or off, opens the picker and Settings, and offers update checks once releases are set up.
- A welcome window walks you through allowing Input Monitoring and Accessibility.
- Signed updates through Sparkle, which you can turn off in Settings.
